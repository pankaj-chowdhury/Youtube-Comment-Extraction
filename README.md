# Youtube-Comment-Extraction
This code is a Python script that uses the Google API Client Library to search for YouTube videos based on a given query.

To obtain a YouTube API key, you need to create a project in the Google Cloud Console and enable the YouTube Data API. Here are the steps to get a YouTube API key:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/

2. Create a new project:
   - Click on the project dropdown menu at the top of the page.
   - Click on the "New Project" button.
   - Enter a name for your project and click on the "Create" button.

3. Enable the YouTube Data API:
   - In the Cloud Console, make sure your newly created project is selected from the project dropdown menu.
   - Use the search bar at the top of the page and type "YouTube Data API".
   - Click on the "YouTube Data API" result that appears.
   - Click on the "Enable" button.

4. Create credentials:
   - In the left sidebar, click on "Credentials".
   - Click on the "Create Credentials" button and select "API key" from the dropdown menu.

5. Copy your API key:
   - A dialog box will appear showing your API key.
   - Click on the "Copy" button to copy the API key to your clipboard.

Now you have your YouTube API key, which you can use in your code to access the YouTube Data API.

Note: Make sure to keep your API key secure and avoid sharing it publicly, as it grants access to your quota and could potentially be misused by others.
